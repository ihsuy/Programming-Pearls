The experiment can be done using the qsort4 function implemented
in the file "sorting_algorithms.cpp" under this repository.
The const int value cut_off at the top of the function could be
modified to achieve different performance. 
In "sorting_algorithms.cpp", I also implemented Profilers 
and couple of vector generators for simpler experiment.
