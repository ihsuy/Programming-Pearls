“How could you experiment to find the best value of cutoff on a particular system?”

The experiment can be done using the qsort4 function implemented in the file [sorting_algorithms.cpp](https://github.com/ihsuy/programming_pearls/blob/master/column11_Sorting/sorting_algorithms.cpp) under this repository.  
The const int value cut_off at the top of the function could be modified to achieve different performance.

In [sorting_algorithms.cpp](https://github.com/ihsuy/programming_pearls/blob/master/column11_Sorting/sorting_algorithms.cpp), I also implemented profilers and 3 vector generators for quicker experiment.
