The Quicksorts in this column represented a subarray with two integer indices; this is necessary in a language like Java, which does not have pointers into arrays. In C or C++, though, it is possible to sort an array of integers using a function like  

```c++
void qsort(int x[], int n)
```

for the original call and for all recursive calls. Modify the algorithms in this column to use this interface.
